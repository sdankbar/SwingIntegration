Environment Variables
"RECAPTURE=1": When a test is run, if an image comparison fails, stored the actual screenshot to disk, overwriting the existing file.  Can be used to automatically update
screenshots when changes are made to the application under test.  Should check the delta file to confirm that the changes are the expected ones.
"WHITE_EQUALS=1": When generating delta, if pixels are equal, output white instead of black.  Helpful for seeing small difference in pixel values.
